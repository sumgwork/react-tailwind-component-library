export const buttonIcon = `
When words are not enough, icons can be used in buttons to better communicate what the button does. Icons should be
always paired with text whenever possible.


Use the \`iconLeft\` and \`iconRight\` prop to add an Icon to the Button. Refer to the Icon documentation for usage.

To show Icons on both sides use both the \`iconLeft\` and \`iconRight\` props.

Using an Button with only an Icon while not being recommended can be achieved by leaving the Button text blank.
